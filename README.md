Firstly, we're going to look into how you log in or sign up on the website. Then, we'll test if the address input works well and finds the right address. It's also important to check that you can edit your profile info. Another big thing we'll check is how payments work and if you can order stuff smoothly. Plus, we'll explore features for people who want to become Glovo couriers or partners.
